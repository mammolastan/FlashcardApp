# FlashcardApp

## About
Support the study habits of your students by using this flashcard app. Mimicing the common notecard or index card, this app allows users to build out decks of cards and then study those cards one by one, viewing first the front side of the card, followed by the rear side. 

This project is a module within my Thinkful development program. 

## Usage
This app is intended to be used by students or anyone engaged in the process of learning. Use to help support the memorization of vocabularly, terminology, or concepts. 

## Tech
This is a React project

## Enhancements
Future improvements include:
- database
- share decks
- permissions
